# Address autocomplete with user's geolocation with PlaceKit Autocomplete JS

Full address autocomplete component implementation, enabling device's geolocation and clear buttons with [PlaceKit Autocomplete JS](https://github.com/placekit/autocomplete-js).

Users providing their geolocation will get more accurate results and consume less API requests on average because of the improved relevance. When their device's geolocation sharing is turned off, our API uses their IP instead.

## Run

See [root README](../../README.md) for installation process.

```sh
npm run dev -w=autocomplete-js-geolocation
```

And your project will be served at http://localhost:5173.
