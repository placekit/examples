# Basic address autocomplete with PlaceKit Autocomplete JS from CDN

Basic address autocomplete with [PlaceKit Autocomplete JS](https://github.com/placekit/autocomplete-js) loaded from the [JSDeliver CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@placekit/autocomplete-js). Any other Autocomplete JS example would work with PlaceKit Autocomplete JS loaded from CDN.

**NOTE:** You won't need Vite to run PlaceKit from CDN. We're using it here just to share the same environment variable across all examples.

## Run

See [root README](../../README.md) for installation process.

```sh
npm run dev -w=autocomplete-js-cdn
```

And your project will be served at http://localhost:5173.
