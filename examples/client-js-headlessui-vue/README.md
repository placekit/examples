# Custom address autocomplete with HeadlessUI Vue and PlaceKit JS Client

Custom address autocomplete with [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com) on top of [PlaceKit JS Client](https://github.com/placekit/client-js).

Headless UI is an open source library of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS. Using icons from [heroicons](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons).

**NOTE**: It is meant as an custom implementation example for advanced development needs.
For a full autocomplete experience, we recommend using [PlaceKit Autocomplete JS](https://github.com/placekit/autocomplete-js).
